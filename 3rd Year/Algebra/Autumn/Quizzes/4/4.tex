\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a finite group with Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$. Prove that any subgroup of $G$ that contains $N_G(P)$ (the normalizer in $G$ of $P$) is equal to its own normalizer.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $H \leq G$ be a subgroup such that $N_G(P) \leq H$. It's clear that $H \leq N_G(H)$ so we must show the other inclusion. Let $x \in G$ such that $xHx^{-1} = H$. Then since $P \leq N_G(P) \leq H$, we have $xPx^{-1} \in Syl_p(H)$. But since any two Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$ are conjugates of each other in $H$, $xPx^{-1} = yPy^{-1}$ for some $y \in H$. Then $y^{-1}xPx^{-1}y = y^{-1}xP(y^{-1}x)^{-1} = P$ and $y^{-1}x \in N_G(P)$. Thus $y^{-1}x \in H$ and since $y^{-1} \in H$, we must also have $x \in H$. Therefore $N_G(H) \leq H$ and we're done.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
Prove that the only group of order $255$ is cyclic.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $|G| = 255$. Note that $255 = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 17$ and by the Sylow divisibility rules, $n_{17} = 1$. Thus $G$ has some normal Sylow $17$-subgroup $P$. Now, recall that $N_G(P)/C_G(P) \cong \aut (P)$. Since $P$ is normal $N_G(P) = G$ and since $|P| = 17$ $|\aut(P)| = \varphi(17) = 16$. Thus $|G/C_G(P)| \mid | 16$. But also, $C_G(P) \leq G$ and so $|G/C_G(P)| \mid 255$. This forces $|G/C_G(P)| = 1$ and hence $C_G(P) = G$. Therefore $P \leq Z(G)$ implying $|Z(G)|$ is a multiple of $17$ and thus $|G/Z(G)|$ is either $1$, $3$, $5$ or $15$. We've shown that all groups of these orders are cyclic, and $G/Z(G)$ being cyclic implies $G$ is abelian. Since $G$ is abelian, every subgroup of $G$ is normal, so $n_3 = 1$ and $n_5 = 1$. Let $Q \in Syl_3(G)$ and $R \in Syl_5(G)$. Note that $P$, $Q$ and $R$ are all cyclic and are generated by the elements $x$, $y$ and $z$ respectively. But since $G$ is abelian, $|xyz| = |P||Q||R| = 255$. Thus $G$ is cyclic.
\end{proof}
